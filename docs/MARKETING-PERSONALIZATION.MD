# Quantized classifier and personalization 

Have you ever purchased a home appliance on  ecommerce site only to be deluged with offers for home appliances.   Once I buy a fridge I am extreemly unlikely to buy a another fridge so why are companies wasting their money to sell me another fridge.

The answer is marketing groups are using tools they have available using well proven rules of thumb but are failing to apply deeper analysis.  Part of it is caused by simplistic engines at advertising sales companies that do not have the ability or data to refine what is offered to the user. 

In reality once I buy a new fridge then I am actually more likely to buy a stove or  very likely to hire a handyman.      This is what we call correlated events were the occurence of one event may indicate the next is more likely.    If I can correlate more of the source events together I can get even more accurate.   For example if I purchased paint and I purchased a new home and my income is over X then I am more likely to both hire a painter and somewhat less likely to buy new windows.    There is also a negative correlation with buying a new car because I have exhausted my tolerance for financial risk when spending  large fraction of my personal savings on the home.

Classification machines can leverage these facts to help marketers know which product or service to offer to a given user.  This can save the marketer money while making happier users.   

The classification engines that include correlation discovery capabilities an also help discover causal events by looking at leading events that happen in clusters before a trailing event.   An example of this is if I recently flew to one of 5 cities like Miami and I have purchased a vacation rental within the last 7 years and I my last vacation rental is more than 18 months ago then I have a 33% chance of buying a vacation rental offered from Hawaii during the next 5 months.   If any of those conditions are false such as I took a major vacation during the last 6 months then I only have a 6% chance of buying the vacation rental.  am fully employed
