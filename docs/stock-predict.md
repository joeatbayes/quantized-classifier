## Data Source

* [Google Data Source](https://finance.google.com/finance/historical?output=csv&q=cat)  Google provides EOD.  Yahoo stopped providing it so the google source may be the best option.
  * [API documentation for google API](http://www.jarloo.com/real-time-google-stock-api/) from jarloo but the sample published does not actually work
  * ​
* [EOD Data](http://www.eoddata.com/) Provides a daily feed but also can provide historic EOD at a moderate cost
* [10 ways to get Historical price data](https://www.quantshare.com/sa-43-10-ways-to-download-historical-stock-quotes-data-for-free)
* [Alternatives to Google Finance API](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10040954/alternative-to-google-finance-api)
* [ally financial](https://www.ally.com/api/invest/documentation/getting-started/) Must maintain account but data is free.
