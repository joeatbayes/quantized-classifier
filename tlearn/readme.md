One of the goals this project is to test some capabilities of tlearn and TensorFlow using the 

 same data sets.   If Market Buzz is correct then  Tensorflow should run faster, require
 less code and produce superior classification results. 

These Tensorflow wrappers are intended to allow us to test TensorFlow against the same set of data we used to test the Quantise probability engine.  

The intent is to Compare 

* A) Runtime for training
* B) Runtime for classifying
* C) Memory cost for training
* D) Memory cost for classification
* E) Classification accuracy at 100%
* F) Classification recall at a given accuracy
* G) Test the common aglorithms supported by TensorFlow
     to see which ones perform better.  We will start with
     CNN the Convolutional Neural Networks and add more as I
     have time.

## Sample Use ##

* **[CNNClassifyBCancer.bat](CNNClassifyBCancer.bat )**   Runs the Tensorflow NN classifier on the Breast Cancer data set.  Uses CNNClassify.py Prints out the classification results.   
* **[CNNClassifyDiabetes.bat](CNNClassifyDiabetes.bat)**   Runs the Tensorflow NN classifier using the Diabetes training and test data. Uses [CNNClassify.py](CNNClassify.py) Prints out the classification results. 
* **[CNNClassifyLiverDisorder.bat](CNNClassifyLiverDisorder.bat)**  Runs the Tensorflow NN classifier using the Diabetes training and test data. Uses [CNNClassify.py](CNNClassify.py) Prints out the classification results. 
* **[CNNClassifyTitanic.bat](CNNClassifyTitanic.bat)**  Runs the Tensorflow NN classifier using the Titanic Survivor training and test data. Uses [CNNClassify.py](CNNClassify.py) Prints out the classification results. 
* **[CNNClassifyWine](CNNClassifyWine)**  Runs the Tensorflow NN classifier using the Wine Tasting training and test data. Uses [CNNClassify.py](CNNClassify.py) Prints out the classification results.   The Tensorflow configuration only scored 64% with n_epoch equal to 30 but when increased to 90 the score improved to 92%. 
* **python [CNNClassify.py](CNNClassify.py) ../data/breast-cancer-wisconsin.adj.data.train.csv ../data/breast-cancer-wisconsin.adj.data.test.csv 30 **    This is done automatically by CNNClassifyBCancer.bat.   Included here to illustrate how to do the same manually. Runs the Tensorflow NN classifier reading the .train.csv file for traing and using the .test.csv file to supply test data. It prints out the classification results.  

## Important Files ##

* **[CNNClassify.py](CNNClassify.py)** Runs the Tensorflow NN classifer reading the .train.csv file for traing and using the .test.csv file to supply test data. It prints out the classification results and shows the precision when forced to 100% recall.  To the best of my knowledge this is the only TensorFlow utility that can run across many different  CSV files that contain differnt sets of clases and different numbers of columns without changing the code.  

* **[TensorFlow-and-TFLearn-Readme.html](TensorFlow-and-TFLearn-Readme.html)** - Notes I made while getting tensor flow running on my windows laptop.


>##Obsolete##
>* **[tlearn/simple_gestures.py](tlearn/simple_gestures.py)** - sample of >reading CSV to  train TensorFlow Model.   Unfortunately this program while it runs does a pour job of classification. I think   this is the result of insufficient training data but there is a chance that I still have a bug in the interface to TensorFlow.

# DONE #
* DONE-2017-01-18 Add command line parms parser to CNNClassify
* DONE-2017-01-17 Convert classify_breast_cancer.py into general purpose   CNNClassifyFiles.py that can handle any file provided    the class is in column 1 and all values are int, float  or can safely be set to 0.0 if they are strings.   Will  need a more complex transform for files that contain   strings but I think I can re-purpose the transform keys  value if we detect any column can not be transformed  to float safely.
